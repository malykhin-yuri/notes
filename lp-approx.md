# Approximation in $\ell_p^N$

Here we will discuss basic properties of the $\ell_p^N$ space related to the Approximation theory.
Let us recall that the norm in $\ell_p^N$ is defined as:
$$
\|x\|_p := \begin{cases}
 (\sum_{k=1}^n |x_k|^p)^{1/p},&\quad 1\le p<\infty,
 \max|x_k},&\quad p=\infty.
\end{cases}
$$
